## üö¶ Graceful Shutdown & Health Monitoring

This system supports graceful shutdown and robust health monitoring, ensuring reliability and observability in production environments.

### üîÑ Graceful Shutdown

- Listens to OS signals (`SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`) via Spring Boot‚Äôs `ContextClosedEvent`
- Shuts down active `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` without interrupting running jobs
- Releases Redis locks for in-progress tasks to avoid deadlocks
- Logs structured shutdown events (start, cleanup, complete) visible in ELK stack
- Designed to safely requeue or move incomplete jobs to a DLQ (extendable)

### üì° Health Monitoring

- Exposes actuator endpoints:
  - `/actuator/health` ‚Äî Overall health
  - `/actuator/health/readiness` ‚Äî Readiness probe
  - `/actuator/health/liveness` ‚Äî Liveness probe
  - `/actuator/prometheus` ‚Äî Prometheus scrape target
- Includes built-in and custom health indicators:
  - ‚úÖ Redis connectivity
  - ‚úÖ Disk space check
  - ‚úÖ Queue size and pressure (`QueueHealthIndicator`)
- Secured via HTTP Basic Auth (`admin / secret123`) for Prometheus & monitoring tools

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Spring Boot Actuator + Prometheus + Grafana integration is production-ready.
