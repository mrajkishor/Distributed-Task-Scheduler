### üß© Architecture Highlights That Make It Distributed

| Component                | Description                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Task Store (Redis)**   | Tasks are stored with metadata and status per tenant‚Äîaccessible from anywhere |
| **ZSET Queue**           | Delayed tasks are pushed into a time-based Redis ZSET queue                   |
| **Delay Queue Poller**   | Polls ZSET for due tasks; each instance works independently (scalable)        |
| **Task Executor**        | Executes tasks (simulate workload); can run on multiple JVMs in parallel      |
| **Distributed Locking**  | Redis `SETNX` ensures that only one instance processes a task at a time       |
| **Notification Service** | Sends async webhook/email, doesn‚Äôt block the main flow                        |

### üßµ Distributed Features in Action

1. **Multiple Worker Instances**

   * You can run **N instances of the scheduler** (JARs or containers).
   * All share Redis, but only one will acquire the task lock due to `SETNX`.

2. **Decoupled Execution**

   * Task lifecycle flows:
     **Submit ‚ûù Redis ‚ûù Poller ‚ûù Lease ‚ûù Executor ‚ûù Retry/Complete ‚ûù Notify**

3. **Horizontal Scaling**

   * Want more throughput? Just run more instances.
   * Each instance competes for tasks but only one wins the lock.

4. **Stateless Services**

   * All components are **stateless** except Redis.
   * This makes deployment on **Kubernetes or ECS** effortless.

### üí° Example

Imagine 3 scheduler instances:

```
+-----------------------+     +-----------------------+     +-----------------------+
| Scheduler Instance 1  |     | Scheduler Instance 2  |     | Scheduler Instance 3  |
|  Poller ‚Üí Executor    |     |  Poller ‚Üí Executor    |     |  Poller ‚Üí Executor    |
+----------+------------+     +----------+------------+     +----------+------------+
           |                             |                             |
           v                             v                             v
                        üîó Shared Redis (ZSET + Task Hashes)
```

* All poll the queue
* Only one acquires lock for a given task
* Retry logic + notifications handled per instance
