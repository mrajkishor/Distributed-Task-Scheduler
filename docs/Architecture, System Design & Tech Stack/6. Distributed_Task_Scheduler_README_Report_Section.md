## 🔄 Communication Flow

Each component interacts via industry-standard protocols:

- `Client ↔ API` via REST (JWT-secured)
- `API ↔ Redis / PostgreSQL` for queue and metadata
- `Workers ↔ Redis / PostgreSQL` for leasing, processing, updating
- `Worker → Kafka (DLQ)` on max retries
- `Notifier → Webhook/Email` on job status
- `Prometheus ↔ API & Workers` for metrics
- `Grafana ← Prometheus` for dashboards
- `Config Server → Services` for dynamic config
- `GitHub Actions → Docker → Kubernetes` for CI/CD

📎 *See details in* `Communication Flow.md`.
