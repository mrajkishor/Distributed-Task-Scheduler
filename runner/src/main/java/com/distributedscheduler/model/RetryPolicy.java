/***
 * About this component
 *
 * This `RetryPolicy` class supports only **fixed delay retries**, not
 * exponential or other backoff strategies.
 *
 * ### üîÅ Meaning of Fields:
 *
 * * **`maxRetries`**: Maximum retry attempts if the task fails (e.g., `3` means
 * it can retry 3 times).
 * * **`delaySeconds`**: Fixed number of seconds to wait between each retry
 * (e.g., `10` means retry every 10 seconds).
 *
 * ### ‚ùóLimitation:
 *
 * There is **no field for `backoff strategy`** like `EXPONENTIAL` in this
 * class.
 * If you want to support multiple strategies (like `EXPONENTIAL`, `LINEAR`,
 * `NONE`), you should:
 *
 * * Add a new field: `private BackoffStrategy backoffStrategy;`
 * * Create an enum `BackoffStrategy { FIXED, EXPONENTIAL, LINEAR }`
 *
 * Future Scope:
 * updating this class to support backoff strategies.
 *
